# Coding Quiz Project

## Description

This website serves as practice for navigating the DOM through javascript webpage APIs. There are two questions, an opening page, and a closing page where you can enter your initials to appear with your score.

## Installation

You can download the files from GitHub, open them in VS Code, and use "run from browser" to run the page from your own computer.

Alternatively, you can visit the github links I created: 
URL of deployed webpage: https://cjrhansen2.github.io/codingquiz-hw4/
URL of GitHub repository: https://github.com/cjrhansen2/codingquiz-hw4

## Usage

Click on the buttons, it will tell you if the answer is incorrect. If it is correct it will move to the next page. At the end you can enter your initials which will appear next to your score.
